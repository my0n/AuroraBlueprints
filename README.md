# AuroraBlueprints [![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/my0n/my0n/_apis/build/status/my0n.AuroraBlueprints?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/my0n/my0n/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Web-based Aurora ship design application written in F# using Fable. Love the game, but always wanted something a little easier on the eyes.

There's a good chance most of these calculations are off by a little or a lot. As of right now I don't even support maintenance calcs. I'm just doing this because F# is fun to write in.

The latest stable version of the website can be found at: https://my0n.github.io/AuroraBlueprints
